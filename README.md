Keep a party of adventurers warm, well fed, safe, and happy.

Made with Unity (v2021.1.0b5). Latest build [here](https://github.com/Stephen-Muehlenberg/Around-the-Fire/blob/main/Latest%20Build/Around%20the%20Fire%20v0.1.6.7z).

## Project Status

This is a proof of concept / prototype. The goal is to experiment with gameplay to find something fun that fits the theme of "cosy party management".

Currently you can assign your heroes to different parts of the camp, choose actions associated with that location, and perform that action when everyone is ready. Next step is to add challenge to the game by having stats deteriorate over time, e.g. hunger and fatigue, which the player must actively raise.
